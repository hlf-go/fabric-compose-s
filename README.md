# Introduction

A collection of predefined scripts to help you spin up fabric networks.

* [tiny](./tiny) - Scripts to create a network with 1 x orderer, 1 x org ( 1 x peer with couchDB)  and 1 x cli. No TLS.
* [tinyca](./tinyca) - Scripts to create a network with 1 x CA, 1 x orderer, 1 x org ( 1 x peer with couchDB) and 1 x cli, TLS enabled.
* [medium](./medium) - Scripts to create a network with 1 x orderer, 2 x orgs ( 1 x peer with couchDB per org) and 1 x cli. TLS not enabled.
* [e2e](./e2e) - Temporary copy of hyperledger fabric e2e example. The plan is to replaced this with a version capable of spanning multiple nodes (e.g. macs) to mimic multiple organisations.
